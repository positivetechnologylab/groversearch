    <h1>Real World Applications</h1>
    <br>
</div>
<div class="custom-box">
    <p>Grover's algorithm can be used to solve real-world problems such as k-SAT problems. A k-SAT problem is a problem consisting of clauses that have k boolean literals, where the goal is to find the solution to all the clauses. The problem includes logical operators such as AND, OR, and NOT that represent the relationship between the boolean literals.</p>

        <h3>Biotechnology</h3>
        <p>In genomes, important polymers such as DNA and RNA consist of codons, such as the pattern "UGU" or "UGC", which represent a sequence of three nucleotides. Each nucleotide has a corresponding "matching" nucleotide. For example, G matches with C. We can think of these values as booleans then, as each nucelotide can be either true or false; if we are trying to find the nucelotide G, the boolean literal can be either true (G) or false (C). We can then model problems based on the clauses we want to see satisfied, such as (U OR G OR NOT C) AND (NOT U OR G OR C). <b> Using k-SAT problems and Grover's search algorithms can potentially streamline the process of protein identification and analysis. </b></p>

        <h3>Weather Controls</h3>
        <p>Say a weather channel is trying to determine what conditions are best for driving. We can model weather controls as a k-SAT problem by checking multiple weather conditions. Each literal would represent a certain weather condition, such as “sunny/not sunny”. For example, if they are trying to decide whether it is a good day for people to go outside, they might want to solve the problem (sunny OR windy) AND (sunny OR not windy).</p>

        <h3>Route Determination</h3>
        <p>Consider navigation apps like Waze, Google Maps, and Apple Maps. We can use k-SAT problems to determine the ideal route for a person to commute to work or school. For example, the literals may be to find a road that is "toll-free/not toll-free" and "light traffic/not light traffic". We can then solve a problem such as (toll-free OR light traffic) AND (toll-free OR not light traffic).</p>

    <p>These are only a few of the real-world applications that k-SAT problems can be used to model. Here are some more (consider how you would represent these problems as literals and clauses):</p>
    <p>Can you think of any others?</p>
